## Data Schema Documentation

Below is a sample data schema to visualize what we retrieve from users’ browsing. Due to privacy concerns and ongoing updates to our extension code, our mainnet published extension currently only retrieves the `url` and `timeSpent` from the structure below to maintain minimal privacy footprint.
