# Architecture Overview

## Components

The YKYR ecosystem comprises four major components:

### YKYR-extension

A browser extension that enables users to collect their browsing data. It serves as the bridge for users to securely send their encrypted data to the YKYR network.

### YKYR-relayer

An off-chain relayer deployed by YKYR to provide a gasless experience for users. It handles the on-chain submission of gathered data, mitigating the gas fees associated with blockchain transactions and facilitating ease of use for Web2 users transitioning to Web3.

### YKYR-IPFS

An IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) server where all user data is stored. Data is encrypted at the extension level, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content. The IPFS hash of the encrypted data is sent on-chain for reference.

### YKYR-DLP-SC

A collection of smart contracts on the Vana network that registers data contributors, manages user wallets for secure interaction, and will soon enable data exchange in a dedicated marketplace.
