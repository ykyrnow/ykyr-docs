# Validator

The validator network forms a crucial component of the YKYR ecosystem, leveraging Vana's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) infrastructure to ensure data authenticity and maintain system integrity.

## Validation Process

### 1. Data Reception
- Receives encrypted data submissions from contributors
- Verifies submission format and basic requirements
- Queues valid submissions for processing

### 2. TEE Verification
- Processes data within secure TEE environment
- Validates data authenticity and ownership
- Ensures compliance with protocol standards
- Generates proof of valid contribution

### 3. Proof Generation
- Creates cryptographic proof of valid contribution
- Records validation results on-chain
- Triggers reward calculation process
- Updates contributor status
