# What is YKYR?

YKYR empowers users to collect, own, and monetize their personal browsing data and behavioral traits. By allowing individuals to gather unique datasets derived from their online activities, YKYR provides a platform where users can profit from their data through a decentralized marketplace or utilize it to train custom AI models tailored to their preferences.

## Problem Statement
In today's digital landscape, users generate vast amounts of personal data through their online interactions. However, this data is often collected, controlled, and monetized by third-party entities without the users' consent or benefit. This raises significant privacy concerns and prevents users from reaping the intrinsic value of their own data.

## Solution
YKYR offers a decentralized solution that returns data ownership to the users. By enabling individuals to securely collect and encrypt their browsing data, YKYR ensures that users maintain full control over their personal information. Through our marketplace, users can monetize their data or leverage it to create personalized AI agents, all while maintaining privacy and security. This not only provides financial incentives but also fosters a more transparent and user-centric data ecosystem.
