## Validator
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) validator provided by the Vana network, responsible for verifying the integrity and authenticity of data contributions.

## Contributor Wallet
A secure, cold-storage wallet designated for receiving rewards. During setup, users set a password to encrypt this wallet, ensuring that their rewards are protected.

## Proxy Wallet
A hot wallet used to automate the signing process for data submissions. This wallet generates an encryption key, enhancing ease of use by minimizing the need for manual signatures.

## Smart Contract Wallet (SCW)
A wallet enabled with account abstraction, allowing seamless interactions with the YKYR on-chain stack, making the blockchain process accessible and user-friendly.

## Encryption
The method used to protect user data, employing symmetric encryption via OpenPGP. The encryption key is derived from the Proxy Wallet's signature of a randomly generated string within the extension. This process ensures that only the contributor can decrypt and access their data, keeping it private.
