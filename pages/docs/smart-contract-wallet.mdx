# Smart Contract Wallet

The YKYR Smart Contract Wallet is a solution designed to bring unparalleled granularity, security, and flexibility to blockchain interactions. Unlike traditional wallets or existing account abstraction solutions, it introduces a highly granular, role-based permission system that allows users to delegate specific functionalities to their task-specific agents without compromising overall wallet security.

## Core Components

### YKYR Wallet Implementation
- Core functionality for role management, data submission, and reward handling
- Utilizes upgradable pattern for future adaptability
- Manages role assignments and transaction handling
- Enables reward address setting and management

### YKYR Wallet Factory
Responsible for deploying new wallet instances using clone (minimal proxy) pattern for:
- Efficient wallet deployment with minimal gas costs
- Standard and relayer-based initialization options

## Roles and Permissions

### Owner
- Primary controller with highest level permissions
- Assigns and revokes proxy and relayer accounts
- Manages reward addresses and claims
- Oversees wallet security and functionality

### Proxy Account
- Authorized by owner for specific actions
- Submits data directly to data registries
- Facilitates delegated operations

### Relayer Account
- Enables off-chain computations and interactions
- Acts as intermediary between owner and blockchain
- Executes transactions and handles data submissions
- Manages TEE pool interactions

## Key Features

### Role Management
- Dynamic role assignment and revocation
- Specific permission granting for different accounts
- Combined role assignment through owner-signed messages

### Data Submission Mechanisms
- **Auto Submission**: Direct data submission by proxy account
- **Relayer Auto Submission**: Off-chain computation and job execution
- Efficient data registry interaction with reduced costs

### Reward Management
- Configurable reward address
- Owner-controlled reward claims
- Transparent operation tracking through events

## Security Features

### Protection Mechanisms
- Signature verification for authorized actions
- Nonce management for replay attack prevention
- Role-based access control
- Strict permission enforcement

### Upgradability
- Upgradeable contract patterns
- Immutable critical addresses
- Protected governance mechanisms

## Use Cases
- DApps: Secure data management and role delegation
- DeFi: Automated transactions and asset protection
- Data Registry: Efficient submission and TEE pool integration
