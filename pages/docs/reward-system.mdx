# Reward System

In the YKYR ecosystem, users earn rewards through Proof of Contribution (PoC) for their data contributions and platform participation.

## How Rewards Work

### 1. Collection Phase
- Install YKYR extension
- Enable data collection
- Start contributing data

### 2. Validation Phase (Proof of Contribution)
Data contributions are validated through Vana's TEE-validator network using a custom Proof of Contribution function. The validation process includes:
- Ownership verification
- Data authenticity check
- Quality assessment
- Pattern verification
- Consistency validation

> **Note**: For detailed information about the validation process, please refer to the [official Vana documentation](https://docs.vana.org/docs/data-attestation).

### 3. Reward Distribution
- Regular reward payments
- Bonus distributions
- Special campaign rewards

## Reward Factors

### Data Quality

### Data Quantity
- Volume of contributed data

## Reward Calculation
Rewards are calculated based on the Proof of Contribution mechanism, which considers:
- Data quality score
- Contribution volume
- Platform participation
- Validation results from TEE-validator network
