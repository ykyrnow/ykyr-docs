# Technical Overview

## Security and Encryption

YKYR prioritizes data security through:

* **Client-Side Encryption**: All data encryption occurs locally within the user's extension, preventing unauthorized access.
* **Private Data Handling**: YKYR does not access or store unencrypted user data at any point.
* **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted data is stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage network, ensuring data integrity and availability.
* **Authorized Access**: Only users with the appropriate decryption keys can access their data, maintaining strict confidentiality.

## High-level Process Flow

This section provides a high-level flow of how the YKYR ecosystem works to ensure security, usability, and rewards for data contributions.

### 1. Account Creation and Management

Users' accounts include three specialized wallets:
1. A **Contributor Wallet** to securely receive rewards
2. A **Proxy Wallet** to automate interactions for ease of use
3. A **Smart Contract Wallet** that allows easy interaction with the blockchain

### 2. Data Collection and Encryption

Users control data collection through a toggle switch in the extension. When activated, browsing metrics are gathered and encrypted locally, with encryption keys generated by the user's Proxy Wallet. This ensures all data is secure and private before submission.

### 3. Decentralized Data Storage

The encrypted data is stored on IPFS, a decentralized network. Only users have the decryption keys, keeping data confidential while allowing storage off-chain for accessibility and reliability.

### 4. Data Verification and Rewards

After data is stored, its integrity is verified, and rewards are issued to users based on the quality and quantity of their contributions, completing the data-sharing and reward cycle.
